# Travel Goals based on Museum of Candy of Web Developer Bootcamp 2022 from Colt Steele

This is a Project proposed by Colt Steele in his course Web Developer Bootcamp. In the course, Steele made a page about candies and to make this project more personal, I decided to make about some places around the wolrd I'd like to visit.
